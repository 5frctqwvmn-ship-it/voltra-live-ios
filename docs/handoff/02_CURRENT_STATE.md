## Latest shipped build

**v0.4.43 / build 70** — label "b70 demo entry source connection-aware +
page registry + debug grid overlay" (shipped 2026-04-30). 5-gate altool
verify passed; Delivery UUID `fc2f3148-6f9e-484e-b83c-23534bcc1582`,
[run 25176969283](https://github.com/5frctqwvmn-ship-it/voltra-live-ios/actions/runs/25176969283)
duration 29s. HEAD at ship: `e10b428fbf4afdb75db8f3ffc72b4730bac49a65`.
Awaiting Apple processing before TestFlight surface.

**Last shipped:** b71 / v0.4.44 / build 71 — V2 canonical live capture
view, V1 chain UI ported, force chart canonical, page-badge hotfix.
Shipped 2026-04-30 23:43 UTC,
[run 25194880211](https://github.com/5frctqwvmn-ship-it/voltra-live-ios/actions/runs/25194880211),
HEAD `26af534`. 5-gate altool verify passed.

**Active cycle:** b72 / v0.4.45 / build 72 — debug-overlay-only ship.
Replaces the b70/V4-D18 9-anchor marker overlay with a 5-state
progressive-density spreadsheet-style grid (off / base 32pt / half
16pt / quarter 8pt / max + region outlines). Same toggle gesture
(build-badge tap), same AppStorage key, new behavior. See ADR
**V4-D22**. Commits on top of the b71 ship tag:

- b72 bookkeeping commit `8bdd88b` — logged the b71 ship to
  `docs/WORK_LOG.md`, opened a b71 QA skeleton in `QA_LOG.md`,
  and captured the b72 design prompt verbatim at
  `docs/handoff/B72_DEBUG_GRID_PROMPT.md` so the repo (not chat)
  is the source of truth.
- b72 grid implementation commit `65ddd5c` —
  `VoltraLive/Views/DebugGridOverlay.swift` rewritten in place
  (Canvas-based renderer, single draw call, anchor-preference
  region overlay for State 4); `BuildBadgeOverlay.swift` tap
  cycles `DebugGridDensity.next()`; legacy `DebugGridMode` enum
  retained behind `// SUPERSEDED` marker for one-line rollback;
  AppStorage key `"debugGridMode"` preserved with legacy-value
  migration via `DebugGridDensity.from(_:)`. CI run
  [25199140398](https://github.com/5frctqwvmn-ship-it/voltra-live-ios/actions/runs/25199140398)
  green; `BUILD SUCCEEDED` with all three b72 files in the
  SwiftCompile manifest.
- b72 version bump v0.4.44/71 → v0.4.45/72 (this commit) —
  `project.yml`, `VoltraLive/Info.plist`, `01_PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`,
  this file. Bot identity.

**Historical (pre-b72):** Seven unshipped b71 commits sat on top
of the b70 ship tag before the b71 cycle landed:
- b70 page-badge double-render hotfix (commit `34ba63e`, 2026-04-30 22:02 UTC).
- b71 force-chart canonicalization — V1's `ForceChartView` is now mounted
  inside `LiveCaptureViewV2.forceChartCard`; the b67-10 parametric-sine
  `ForceChartV2` is retained on disk as a SUPERSEDED rollback artifact
  but is no longer mounted anywhere. See ADR **V4-D20** in
  `04_DECISIONS_AND_CONSTRAINTS.md` (supersedes V4-D13). The user's
  verbatim rationale: "the V1 ForceChartView is the one that displays
  the force curve correctly in practice." Commit `92cac54`.
- b71 below-chart parity port (V4-D21 part 1 of 3) — V2 now matches V1's
  `upcomingSetCard` / `dropSetSection` / `loggedSetsSection` /
  `bottomActions` surface area: `SetMode` chips picker, `Target N reps`
  chip, visible drop-cascade cancel chip, mode-aware ±step nudgers (V1
  Combined parity ±2 / ±6), full onAppear writer-cache wipe + workout-
  mode + Combined-parity hooks, onChange `mdm.workoutMode`, onDisappear
  `health.stop()`. Required before the Step 3 routing flip so chain
  users routed through V2 still see every below-chart affordance.
  Equivalence documented for `upcomingSetCard` chrome and load/unload
  pair (V2 surfaces both via `weightCard` + `toggleHardwareLoad`).
  See ADR **V4-D21**. Commit `b93b4fe`.
- b71 chain / superset UI port into V2 (V4-D21 part 2 of 3) — full V1
  SWAP semantics now live in `SupersetSwitcherBanner` (force-finalize
  current set → unload outgoing → flip slot → switch active instance →
  restore chain weight + re-anchor cascade → host pushes device state),
  and V2 wires the three V1 lifecycle hooks: onAppear chain restore
  (LiveCaptureView.swift:242-248), onChange `currentSet` flip →
  `mdm.lockSupersetTag()` (264-268), onChange `mdm.supersetActiveSlot`
  → `switchActiveInstanceByExerciseName` (283-288). B53 "no auto-LOAD
  on incoming" safety preserved verbatim. Commit `2488484`.
  See ADR **V4-D21 part 2**.
- b71 routing flip: V2 is canonical (V4-D21 part 3 of 3) —
  `LiveCaptureContainer.shouldUseV2` collapsed from the three-stage
  conditional cascade (`hasChain → V1` / `bothPaired → V2` / else
  preference) to a single line `return uiVersion != "v1"`. V2 now
  renders for every session shape; `@AppStorage("liveCaptureUIVersion")`
  is an emergency rollback kill switch only. The pre-b71 `"Should V2
  become the default?"` open question (10_OPEN_QUESTIONS) is resolved
  and moved to Recently closed. 08_SUPERSET routing section rewritten
  to reflect the new policy. V1 source code is retained on disk as a
  verbatim rollback artifact — deletion is deferred to a future build
  (b75+ at the earliest, after 2 clean V2 ships). Commit `c7427ce`.
  See ADR **V4-D21 part 3**.
- b71 V1↔V2 parity verification audit (Step 6) — source-level
  audit of all eight items in the b71 mandate (LOAD/UNLOAD,
  ±5/±1 nudgers, Combined dual-fire, 4-row live grid, HR/KCAL,
  rest/idle, force chart live + `lastFinalizedSamples`, chain
  routing through V2). All eight pass; six are verbatim ports,
  one (HR/KCAL) is a behavioral equivalent, one (4-row grid) is
  a documented intentional V2 redesign. Full table in
  `docs/handoff/B71_PARITY_VERIFICATION.md`. Commit `c797d7f`.
- b71 version bump v0.4.43/70 → v0.4.44/71 — `project.yml`,
  `VoltraLive/Info.plist`, `01_PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`, this file.
  Final commit per the b71 mandate (after all six scope items
  landed). Bot identity. NO push. NO altool.

Version bump committed in this cycle as the FINAL commit per the
b71 mandate (after all six scope items landed: hotfix retention,
force chart, below-chart parity, chain UI port, V1 fallback
removal, parity audit). Push and TestFlight ship are pending
explicit user approval per the standing constraint.

## What works today

> **b71 V4-D21 part 3 routing note:** as of b71 V2 is the canonical
> live capture view for every session shape. The bullets below that
> historically read "V1 only" or "V1 fallback" describe the runtime
> view as **V2** post-b71. V1 source remains on disk as an emergency
> rollback artifact reachable via the `liveCaptureUIVersion = "v1"`
> kill switch, but is not on the default render path.

- Live capture (V2, canonical post-b71) — full feature set including
  drop-set cascade, weight nudges, added-plates, expanded set rows,
  superset chain SWAP, dual-Voltra Independent / Combined.
  V2 layout: header → phase strip OR rest-timer bar →
  `SupersetSwitcherBanner` (chain-aware) → WEIGHT card with
  hardware-load tap on big number + nested mod rows + 4-up mod tile
  grid + per-engaged-mod stepper rows + `Target N reps` chip +
  `SetMode` chips row → REPS / TOTAL VOLUME tiles → force chart
  (V1's `ForceChartView` raw-sample phase-colored polyline +
  Catmull-Rom smoothing + secondary-trace superset overlay, per ADR
  V4-D20) → drop-cascade cancel chip (self-hides unless cascade is
  live) → V1RestoreSection (pulley chip + added-plates picker +
  LOGGED SETS swipeable list + Next-exercise + End-session).
  ±step nudgers are mode-aware via `CombinedParity`.
- Live capture (V1, retained as rollback artifact) — unchanged from
  b70. Same feature set, reachable only via the kill switch.
- Dual-Voltra Independent + Combined modes — Twin Mode pill cluster
  with focus-aware mod routing (b58/V4-D9), now rendering through V2.
- Superset chain — per-instance `assignedVoltra` routing source-of-
  truth (b53), 3-way Left/Right/Both picker, SWAP-no-auto-LOAD
  safety, now rendering through V2 via `SupersetSwitcherBanner`'s
  V1-verbatim swap flow + V2's three V1 lifecycle hooks (b71
  V4-D21 part 2).
- HealthKit HR + active calories streaming with PulseDot freshness
  indicators.
- Session export with sessionVitalsCard (AVG HR / KCAL / TOTAL VOL /
  DUR) and comparisonCard vs prior session of same dayTypeRaw.
- Markdown export with fixed-width table.
- **Demo Mode** with synthetic telemetry pump (b59/V4.6.3, b68 V4-D16
  auto-engage on weight-tap LOAD, b70 V4-D17 connection-aware entry on
  every live call site + cold-launch rehydration + root demo→live
  handoff observers).
- Cold-launch routes unconditionally to LoggingHomeView (b67/V4.3 Bug 01
  flip). ConnectView is reserved for legacy onboarding deeplinks only.
- Shared PairingCoordinator (b67/V4-D15) — single sheet presenter for
  any tap-to-pair gesture from any screen.
- VoltraUnitHeader (b67/V4-D14) — single canonical L/R unit-status row
  on Workout, Live, and Detail screens; replaces VoltraAssignmentPanel
  + telemetryPulsePill + connectionPill chrome.
- Page-name badge with **stable numeric IDs** via `PageRegistry` (b66
  + b70/V4-D18). Render format: `"NN · ScreenName"`.
- **Debug grid overlay** (b70/V4-D18 → b72/V4-D22) — five-state
  progressive-density spreadsheet-style grid (off / base 32pt /
  half 16pt / quarter 8pt / max + region outlines) toggled by
  tapping the build-version chip; persisted via
  `@AppStorage("debugGridMode")`. Replaces the b70 9-anchor
  marker overlay; legacy `DebugGridMode` enum retained behind a
  `// SUPERSEDED` marker for rollback.

## Live capture mode handling matrix

| Scenario                                     | Renders |
|----------------------------------------------|---------|
| 1 Voltra paired, no chain, V1 chosen         | V1 |
| 1 Voltra paired, no chain, V2 chosen         | **V2** |
| 1 Voltra paired, chain has ≥1 entry          | V1 (b54 tightened gate) |
| 2 Voltras paired, Independent                | V1 |
| 2 Voltras paired, Combined                   | V1 |
| 2 Voltras paired, Superset chain             | V1 (b53 chain fixes apply) |

V2 is single-Voltra-no-chain only by design. `LiveCaptureContainer`
at `VoltraLive/Logging/Views/LiveCaptureContainer.swift` enforces this gate.

## V2 design source

V2 is a port of the b55 sign-off render at `voltra-v2-preview/index.html`
PLUS the b56 spec dump (3-state rest-timer screenshot + spec text).
The b55-era layout note ("1:1 port of design-system/ui-kit.html") is
OBSOLETE — the actual layout-of-truth has been the web preview since
b55, and now also the b56 spec.

**Before changing V2, re-read the WORK_LOG b55 + b56 entries and
`voltra-v2-preview/index.html`.** Do not rely on prose summaries.

## Demo Mode contract (b70 / V4-D17)

Live UI MUST select `DemoEntrySource` from the connection state at
call time:

```
let source: DemoEntrySource = anyDeviceConnected ? .postPair : .prePair
demo.enter(source: source, onTelemetry: handler)
```

`anyDeviceConnected = ble.connectionState.isConnected
  || mdm.left.connectionState.isConnected
  || mdm.right.connectionState.isConnected`

`.settingsRestore` is **legacy** and MUST NOT appear in any live call
site. Lint gate: `rg "source:\s*\.settingsRestore" VoltraLive` → 0.
The case is retained in `DemoEntrySource` for trace-replay
compatibility only.

Cold-launch rehydration (`VoltraLiveApp.swift`) calls
`demo.enter(source: .prePair, ...)` when `demo.settingsToggleOn` was
left on across a launch. ContentView's `.onChange` observers on the
three connection-state sources call `demo.exit()` when an active
prePair session sees a real device come up.

`DemoController.enter(...)` self-heals if a session is active but
the synthetic pump is missing AND `entrySource == .prePair`. The
self-heal branch reads `entrySource` (the controller's published
source-of-truth), NOT the incoming `source` parameter.

## Known issues / not yet built

1. No Settings toggle to switch back from V2 to V1 after picking V2
   in the first-launch picker. Tracked for a future build.
2. V2 has no chain affordances by design. If a user tries to add a
   second exercise while on V2, the container falls back to V1.
3. `swapSupersetSide` is no-auto-LOAD by design. After a SWAP, the
   user must tap LOAD to arm the new side. Document in any
   user-facing release note.
4. b56 V2 DROP is finalize-driven (advances `manualDropIndex` when
   the next set starts). The legacy V1 timer-cascade `startDropSet`
   still exists for V1 and is not wired into V2.
5. Architect's H1/H2/H4 demo hypotheses are not falsified yet but
   were de-prioritized in b70 (only H3 fixed). Re-evaluate post-b70
   if the user reports any residual demo-mode symptoms.

## Apple's version-component rule

`CFBundleShortVersionString` must be ≤ 3 components (e.g. `0.4.43`,
not `0.4.43.1`). Use `CFBundleVersion` (build number) for finer
granularity.

## Three places to bump on every release

1. `VoltraLive/Info.plist` → `CFBundleShortVersionString` and
   `CFBundleVersion`
2. `project.yml` settings block (lines ~64-65): `MARKETING_VERSION`
   and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`
3. `project.yml` `info.properties` block (lines ~92-93):
   `CFBundleShortVersionString` and `CFBundleVersion`

Plus `VOLTRAFeatureLabel` in both files when it should be set. All
must agree or signing fails.

## Doc bumps on every release

Per `00_START_HERE.md:135`, the Karpathy `01_PROJECT_STATE` role
maps to BOTH:

- `docs/handoff/01_PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — update the "Current
  shipping build" line at the top.
- `docs/handoff/02_CURRENT_STATE.md` — overwrite the "Latest shipped
  build" + "Active cycle" lines and any sections whose content has
  drifted since the last ship.

Both must update together. Do NOT touch `docs/WORK_LOG.md` history
(append-only) or any file under `docs/handoff/_tmp/` or
`docs/handoff/archive/`.
