# WORK_LOG

Append-only journal. Newest at the bottom. Every meaningful change to the
codebase or to the handoff docs gets one entry here, committed in the same
commit as the change.

## Entry format

```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC — <one-line goal>

- **Files changed:** path/one, path/two
- **What changed:** Short factual description.
- **Verification:** What you ran or observed (build, test, manual on device).
- **Risks:** Anything that could break or that you didn't fully test.
- **Next step:** The next thing the next session should do.
```

Keep entries short. If something needs a long explanation, that explanation
belongs in a handoff doc (`docs/handoff/*.md`) and the WORK_LOG entry just
points at it.
